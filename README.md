# hello-world

a tornado flew around my room before you came

too many joyrides in daddy's jaguar
too many white lies and white lines
super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

I'm searching for that real love
reeaal love
I'M SEACHING FOR THAT REAL LOVe
talkin bout rEEAAALL LOVE
